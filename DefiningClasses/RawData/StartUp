//Write a program that tracks cars and their cargo.Define a class Car that holds an information about model, engine, cargo and a collection of exactly 4 tires.The engine, cargo and tire should be separate classes.Create a constructor that receives all of the information about the Car and creates and initializes its inner components (engine, cargo and tires).
//On the first line of input, you will receive a number N - the number of cars you have.On each of the next N lines, you will receive an information about each car in the format:
//"{model} {engineSpeed} {enginePower} {cargoWeight} {cargoType} {tire1Pressure} {tire1Age} {tire2Pressure} {tire2Age} {tire3Pressure} {tire3Age} {tire4Pressure} {tire4Age}"
//The speed, power, weight and tire age are integers and tire pressure is a double. 
//After the N lines, you will receive a single line with one of the following commands: 
//"fragile" - print all cars whose cargo is "fragile" with a tire, whose pressure is  < 1
//"flamable" - print all of the cars, whose cargo is "flamable" and have engine power > 250
//The cars should be printed in order of appearing in the input.
