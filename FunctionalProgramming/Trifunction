//Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the first name, whose sum of characters is equal to or larger than a given number N, which will be given on the first line.Use a function that accepts another function as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program.Something along the lines of Func<string, int, bool>. Afterwards create your main function which should accept the first function as one of its parameters.

using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace _12.Trifunction
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			int length = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

			var names = Console.ReadLine().Split();

			Func<string, int, bool> checking = (name, length) => name.Sum(x => x) >= length;

			Func<string[], Func<string, int, bool>, string> namesFilter =
				(names, checking) => names.FirstOrDefault(x => checking(x, length));

			string resultName = namesFilter(names, checking);

			Console.WriteLine(resultName);
		}
	}
