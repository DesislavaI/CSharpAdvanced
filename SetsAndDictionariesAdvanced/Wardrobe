//Write a program that helps you decide what clothes to wear from your wardrobe.You will receive the clothes, which are currently in your wardrobe, sorted by their color in the following format:
//"{color} -> {item1},{item2},{item3}…"
//If you receive a certain color, which already exists in your wardrobe, just add the clothes to its records.You can also receive repeating items for a certain color and you have to keep their count.
//In the end, you will receive a color and a piece of clothing, which you will look for in the wardrobe, separated by a space in the following format:
//"{color} {clothing}"
//Your task is to print all the items and their count for each color in the following format: 
//"{color} clothes:
//* { item1} - {count}
//* {item2} - {count}
//* {item3} - {count}
//…
//* {itemN} - {count}"
//If you find the item you are looking for, you need to print "(found!)" next to it:
//"* {itemN} - {count} (found!)"
